# Personal Tech Blog

## Overview

The "Personal Tech Blog" application is a full stack application that utilizes a backend and a front-end
to allow users to interact with the platform. The backend is in charge of handling the logic of the front-end and keeping track of the user data that is created. We are leveraging API routes and a SQL database to handle user data creation and navigation.

On the front-end we are using Handlebars to render dynamic HTML content that the user can interact with, 
we are also rendering dynamic HTML content based on data that is stored in our database.

## Usage

In order for you to be able to utilize this application, you must ensure that you have the appropriate packages and dependencies installed, to accomplish this, please make sure that you run the `npm i` command. This will scan through our package.json file and install any packages/dependencies. 

Once you have installed the appropriate packages/dependencies, you should be able to connect to a local SQL database or through a webhosted database. Once you have decided on database usage, you can run the command `npm run seeds` which will seed data into your database instance. 

To initialize the app, you will need to run the command `npm start`, this will run the development server
which is used to handle the front-end routing as well as the backend routing.
